/*
You recently started working in the IT department of a large store.
You were put in charge of the inventory database availableItems,
which has the following structure:

    - id: unique item ID;
    - item_name: the name of the item;
    - item_type: the type of the item.

Note that it is possible for items that are of different types to have
the same names.

One of the most common operations performed on this database is querying
the number of specific items available at the store. Since the database
is quite large, queries of this type can take up too much time. You have
decided to start analyzing this problem by counting the number of each
available item.

Given the availableItems table, write a select statement which returns the
following three columns: item_name, item_type and item_count, containing the
names of the items, their types, and the amount of those items, respectively.
The output should be sorted in ascending order by item type, with items of
the same type sorted in ascending order by their names.

CREATE PROCEDURE solution()
BEGIN
	SELECT item_name, item_type, COUNT(*) AS item_count
    FROM availableItems
    GROUP BY item_name, item_type
    ORDER BY item_type, item_name;
END
